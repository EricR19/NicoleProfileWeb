## ⚙️ Customization Options

### Change Video Duration

**File:** `src/components/About.jsx` (Line ~50)

```javascript
}, 5000); // Video plays for 5 seconds - change this number
```

Examples:
- `3000` = 3 seconds
- `6000` = 6 seconds
- `8000` = 8 seconds

### Change Video Position in Slideshow

**File:** `src/components/About.jsx` (Lines ~30-36)

```javascript
const media = [
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-1.jpg' },
  { type: 'video', src: '/nicole-video.mp4' }, // Move this line anywhere
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-2.jpg' },
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-3.jpg' },
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-4.jpg' },
];
```

**To put video at beginning:** Move video line to top  
**To put video in middle:** Move video line between images  
**Current:** Video is at the end

### Add More Videos

1. Add video to `/public/` folder (e.g., `nicole-video-2.mp4`)
2. Add to media array:

```javascript
const media = [
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-1.jpg' },
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-2.jpg' },
  { type: 'video', src: '/nicole-video.mp4' },
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-3.jpg' },
  { type: 'video', src: '/nicole-video-2.mp4' }, // Second video
  { type: 'image', src: '/nicole-4.jpg' },
];
```

### Enable Video Sound

**File:** `src/components/About.jsx` (Line ~112)

```javascript
muted // Remove this line to enable sound
```

**Note:** Browsers may block autoplay with sound. User may need to interact first.

12s → Photo 4 appears
16s → Video starts playing (from 0:00)
21s → Video stops, resets to 0:00, Photo 1 appears

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Video not playing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure video file is in `/public/` folder
- Try refreshing the page
- Some browsers require user interaction first

### Video continues after 5 seconds?
- Check the timeout value in line ~50
- Ensure the video ref is working

### Video doesn't reset?
- The code sets `currentTime = 0` to reset
- This happens when leaving the video slide
